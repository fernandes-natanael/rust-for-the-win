`rustfmt`: fast format code.
`cargo new`: create a new cargo project.
`cargo build`: create an executable from the project at _targer/debug/project_name_.
`cargo run`: compile the project and run.   
`cargo check`: check if the project can be compiled, but don't create an executable. (faster than build, and it's a good practice).
`cargo build --release`: build an project with optimization, which is ready to release. The con is the time to compile will be longer.
